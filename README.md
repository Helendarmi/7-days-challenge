This a quiz app made for the 7 day challenge with Andela Learning Community in association with Google.

The quiz app has 5 questions. The score appears at the top of the screen, the question is below the score and the options for the answer are below the question. Each right answer adds 1 to your score. When a wrong answer is chosen, the game ends, revealing the total score of the player. A message appears asking the player to start a new game or to exit.
